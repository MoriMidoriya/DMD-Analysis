# Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) Analysis 📈🔍

Welcome to the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis of our dataset! In this project, we apply DMD to understand and visualize the underlying dynamics of our feature data.

## What is DMD? 🤔

Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven algorithm used to decompose complex systems into simpler components. Here's what it does:
1. **Extracts Dynamic Patterns:** DMD identifies spatial and temporal patterns in your data, breaking them down into modes and their dynamics over time.
2. **Reconstructs Data:** Using these modes, DMD can reconstruct the original data, helping us visualize and understand the system's behavior.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MoriMidoriya/DMD-Analysis.git
    cd DMD-Analysis
    ```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn lazypredict pydmd
    ```

3. **Run the Analysis:**
    ```sh    
    python dmdanalysis.py
    ```
